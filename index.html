      <p1>Some people have a childhood they can look back on with wonderful memories. Playing in the yard, 
         catching their first fish, sibling scuffles...Some people don't have those luxeries. Some people have
         a childhood friend that doesn't go away, a friend that people tell you isn't real, but you can see him...clear as day.

             Supernatual instances were a daily part of my existance growing up. I found that those around me never believed until 
             I proved it to them. Friends came and went, and I spent a lot of my childhood alone. Until one day, I decided to confront
             my imaginary friend...

         "Why do you scare my friends away", I asked softly one night, while in my bed. 
         "Why do you care? You have me. Aren't I enough?"
         He sounded cold when he spoke. Not like Mom or Dad when I accidentally broke something playing in the house. More like
         someone who decided a long time ago that nothing mattered.
         "I decided we can't be friends anymore"
         I tried to sound confident. It was hard to sound confident at 10 years old.
         He laughed his cold laugh. 'There has to be a way out', I thought to myself.
         Another laugh.
         "No my friend, there is no way out. Besides what are you trying to escape? You have no friends, no future. Just accept 
         my offer and we can leave this place, and I'll show you a world full of fun."
         He hadn't mentioned his offer in some time. He told me that he could take me away with him several times, it was usually
         brought up when I was playing on the bridge by the river.
         "The next time we go, all you have to do is jump."

         I stepped into the car, and slid into the hot seat on that August day. We were moving to Tennessee to follow my Mom's work.
         Or at least that's what they told me. Over the last few years, things had changed at home. My parents were 
         unhappy, and they started seeing my imaginary friend. He waved as we drove away, and I haven't seen him since.
